On holes environment train RNN with:
- Angle direction goal
- goto(x,y) goal

On flat ground train Reactive policy do:
- Walk with variable speed and body height
- Enforce various leg constraints for symmetric motion (symmetricity gait from paper, joint energy penalty)

On holes, tiles, pipe with Reactive policy train
- Expert policies
- Train observer

- Gather gait pattern data on various gaits
